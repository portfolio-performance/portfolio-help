# Join Translation Teams

Portfolio Performance is currently translated into multiple languages. To expand its accessibility and improve the quality of translations, we warmly invite contributors to join our translation teams.

---

## Why Join the Translation Effort?

Accurate and natural translations make Portfolio Performance easier and more enjoyable to use for speakers of many languages worldwide. Your help ensures the app feels native and polished.

## How to Contribute a New Language or Assist with Translations

1. **Register with the POEditor Project**  
   To start contributing, please register here:  
   [Join the POEditor Project](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=4lYKLpEWOY)  
   This platform is where all translation work happens and is managed.

2. **Opening a Ticket for New Languages**  
   If you plan to add a completely new language and need test builds or further support, please open a ticket in the issue tracker. This helps us coordinate and provide necessary resources.

3. **Translation Workflow**  
   Before a new release, the development team downloads and merges all updated translations from POEditor into the Portfolio Performance codebase. This ensures your translations are included in the next app update.

## Important Notes for Translators

- **Translate into Your Native Language if Possible**  
  To ensure the highest quality, we strongly recommend that translations are done by native speakers or those fluent enough to provide accurate, natural phrasing.

- **ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English Is the Reference Language**  
  All translations are based on English source strings. It is important to understand the English context and meaning clearly before translating.

## If You Are Contributing Code

If you are adding new features or labels that require translation, please follow these guidelines:

- Use **Source â†’ Externalize Strings** in Portfolio Performance to extract new strings that need translation. This ensures all new text is included properly in resource files.

- Edit and format resource files using the **ResourceBundle Editor**. The update process from POEditor depends on the format produced by this editor, so proper formatting is crucial.

- For new labels or strings, translate them into all existing languages. You may use machine translation tools like **DeepL** to speed up initial drafts, but these should be reviewed by native speakers.
