On rare occasions, the Portfolio Performance app may malfunction or crash. Under the **Help** menu, three key options can assist in such cases.

## Show Error Log

Each time the app starts, it generates a log file. You can view this log from within the application via `Help > Show Error Log`. Double-clicking a message displays the full entry. If no error occurred, the log will be minimal:

When errors occur, they are listed sequentially:

Double-clicking an error entry opens more detailed information:

If the portfolio can still be opened, you should correct the historical price source for the affected security. If not, open the XML file in a text editor and manually remove the faulty data source.

You can copy the log text to the clipboard, for example when asking for help in the [forum](https://forum.portfolio-performance.info/), or save it to a file.

## Save Error Log

The log file is automatically saved in your user directory. Its default location depends on your operating system:

- **Windows**:  
  `C:\Users\Your-name\AppData\Local\PortfolioPerformance\workspace\.metadata\`

- **macOS**:  
  `/Users/Your-name/Library/Application Support/name.abuchen.portfolio.ui/workspace/.metadata/`

- **Linux**:  
  `/home/Your-name/.portfolio-performance/workspace/.metadata/`

To export the current log to a `.log` file, use the command `Help > Save Error Log`.

This version contains more technical details than the in-app error window:

When reporting issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/issues), include this log file. Avoid uploading portfolios that contain sensitive data.

## Debug: Reset UI

The `Help > Debug: Reset UI` option opens a dialog. After confirming, restart the application:

Figure: Successful reset confirmation {class="pp-figure"}  
![](./images/reset-UI-successful.png)

Resetting the UI **does not** affect:

- Created views
- Custom reporting periods
- Recent Files list

It **does** reset:

- Window size and position
- Visibility/layout of panes
- Open files (not reopened on restart)

Use **Reset UI** as a minimal-impact first step when troubleshooting UI issues.

## Update Error

If the installation is corrupted or files are missing, automatic updates may fail. In such cases, an error message will appear:

The recommended solution is to delete and reinstall the application.
