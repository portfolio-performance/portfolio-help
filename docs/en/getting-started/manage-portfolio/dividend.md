## Dividend transaction
Recording a dividend is similar to recording a buy or sale transaction, except that `Quote price` is replaced with `Dividend payment per shares` (see Figure 1). The number of shares is automatically determined based on the entered date.

There isn't a dedicated function for recording a "Dividend Investment Plan" (DRIP). One workaround is to record all dividends in full and then proceed with a purchase of the agreed-upon number of shares.More information at [Reinvesting dividends](../../how-to/handling-choice-dividend.md).
