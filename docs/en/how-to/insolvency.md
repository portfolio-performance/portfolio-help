title: Insolvency
---

Insolvency occurs when a company is unable to pay their bills.
Investors might see a notice that Administrators or Receivers are appointed,
which realistically means your securities are probably worthless.

The value can be depreciated as follows:

1. Edit the security and set `Quote Feed Provider` to `No automatic quote download`.

1. In the Information pane view Historical quotes, select the prices to be deleted then use the context menu to Delete them.

1. In the `All Securities` context menu, Quotes, Create manually, enter a Quote at least `0.00000001`.

Once the proceedings are concluded:

- In the case of restructuring: write up security to the corresponding value.
- In the event of insolvency: write down security to zero.
