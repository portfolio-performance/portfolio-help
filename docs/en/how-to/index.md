The how-to section of this manual is designed to help you apply the features and functions of the PP program in a real working context.  Unlike the "Getting-started" section, which use more general and use simplified examples, the how-to section shows you how to use the program in a real environment with real data. The how-to section covers topics such as:

- Importing stock data
- Reinvesting dividends
- Recording stock splits and spin-offs.
- Downloading historical data from various sources.


The how-to section is not a substitute for the tutorials, which provide a more comprehensive and pedagogical introduction to the program. Nor is it a substitute for the basic concepts and the reference manual sections, which explain the theoretical foundations and the technical details of the program. The how-to section is meant to complement these other sections by providing practical guidance and tips for using the program effectively.


We have added also some tips and tricks, with many of them initially discussed on the [PP forum](https://forum.portfolio-performance.info). It's worth noting that a significant portion of the information on the forum is in German, but you can utilize your browser's Translate function to comprehend it in your preferred language.
