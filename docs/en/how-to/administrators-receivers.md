title: Insolvency
---

Insolvency occurs when a company is unable to pay their bills.
Investors might see a notice that Administrators or Receivers are appointed,
which realistically means your securities are probably worthless.

The value can be depreciated as follows:

1. Edit the security and set Quote Feed Provider to No automatic quote download

1. In the Information pane view Historical quotes, select the prices to be deleted then use the context menu to Delete them

1. In the All securities context menu, Quotes, Create manually, enter a Quote at least `0.00000001`

Once the  proceedings are concluded:

- In the case of restructuring: write up security to the corresponding value
- In the event of insolvency: write down security to zero
