title: Administrators or Receivers Appointed
---

If Administrators or Receivers are appointed then realistically your securities are probably worthless.

The value can be depreciated as follows:

1. Edit the security and set Quote Feed Provider to No automatic quote download

1. In the Information pane view Historical quotes, select the prices to be deleted then delete with the context menu

1. In the All securities context menu, Quotes, Create manually, and enter a Quote at least `0.00000001`

1. In the All securities context menu, Set security inactive
