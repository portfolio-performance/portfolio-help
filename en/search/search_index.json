With Portfolio Performance, you can:</p> <ul> <li>track the composition and development of your securities portfolio with meaningful overviews, key figures, and charts.</li> <li>track historical price developments of securities and your purchases and sales.</li> <li>classify the securities in your portfolio according to your needs and visualize the composition, e.g., by asset classes and regions.</li> <li>define and track your portfolio strategy with your planned asset allocation and ensure rebalancing.</li> <li>create a comprehensive view across multiple depots and clearing accounts.</li> <li>quickly and conveniently import statements from online banks and brokers.</li> </ul> <p>Portfolio Performance (PP) itself tries to remain as simple and intuitive as possible. However, explanations are sometimes necessary \u2013 as shown by the many similar questions in the forum. This \"handbook\" is intended to guide you through the first steps with Portfolio Performance, explain basic concepts, and document the features that require explanation.</p> <p></p> <p>The Portfolio Performance (PP) guide consists of four chapters, derived from a well-known framework for creating documentation. The documentation is structured along two axes: practical versus theoretical knowledge and learning versus applying.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Getting started   If you are new to Portfolio Performance, this chapter will make it easier for you to get started.   It covers everything from installation to creating a new portfolio, importing securities and transaction data, and evaluating your entire portfolio.</p> </li> <li> <p>Basics   Although Portfolio Performance is an extremely intuitive and user-friendly program, the underlying financial concepts can be complex. This chapter provides a brief but clear understanding of the most important Portfolio Performance concepts, such as accounts, transactions, reporting periods, internal rate of return, and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reference Manual   is a detailed and technical description of all functions and elements of the program's user interface.</p> </li> <li> <p>How-to   In this chapter, you will find step-by-step descriptions of common procedures, including data import, dividend posting, searching for historical prices, and more.

Portfolio performance is all about numbers. It is easy to completely miscalculate or misinterpret these numbers, if you don't understand the underlying assumptions.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Financial terminology: Understanding basic financial terminology is crucial for optimal usage of Portfolio Performance and this manual. This page contains a few links to excellent sites.</p> </li> <li> <p>Portfolio Performance terminology: This glossary is a simple alphabetically sorted list of terms, acronyms, column headings, and other relevant vocabulary used in Portfolio Performance, accompanied by their respective definitions.</p> </li> <li> <p>System overview: Provides a bird's-eye view of how Portfolio Performance operates. It discusses all components and their interactions, with a focus on the main goal: calculating the portfolio's performance. An example is also provided.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transaction: A financial transaction is an agreement between a buyer and seller to exchange goods, services, or assets for payment. In case of PP, the exchange is about securities. There are security transactions such as buy, sell delivery (inbound), and delivery (outbound); deposit transactions such as deposit, removal, interest, interest charge, fees, fees refund, taxes, tax refund; and dividend transactions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reporting period: The (reporting) period is the time slice that is taken into account for reporting (calculations, graphs, statistics). It's very important that you realize that for every performance calculation a reporting period is taken into account, even if you haven't set one explicitly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Purchase value: The Purchase Value of a security is the summed\u00a0value\u00a0of each buy (+) and sell (-) transaction of that security, taken into account the reporting period. The value of a transaction includes the taxes and fees; sometimes also called \u201cNet Transaction Value\u201d.</p> </li> <li> <p>Performance: Measuring your portfolio's performance may seem straightforward, but it involves a range of concepts and calculation techniques that require explanation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Historical prices: To calculate performance, Portfolio Performance requires two types of historical prices: the historical quotes of securities and in case of foreign investments, the historical exchange rates for currencies.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"concepts/cost-methodology/","title":"Gains and Acquisiton Cost principle : FIFO vs Moving Average","text":"<p>To accurately assess realized and unrealized gains after the sale of a security, the sold amount and the remaining market value must be compared against the acquisition cost of the security. While this is straightforward in the case of a single purchase followed by a sale, various definitions and methodologies apply when multiple purchases and sales occur at different prices.

These exchange rates are retrieved from The European Central Bank (ECB) and go back until the year 1999 when the EUR was introduced on the financial markets. They are in fact reference rates and will probably differ slightly from the real transaction rates that your broker or bank will use.</p> <p>Figure 1. Exchange Rates. </p> <p>Securities are traded on exchange markets such as NASDAQ or XETRA, where buyers and sellers agree on a price. Historical quotes are the prices of securities at different points in time. The <code>Close</code> price is the last price of the security at the end of the trading day. Other types are the <code>Open</code> quote, the first price of the security at the start of the trading day, the <code>Low</code> and <code>High</code>quotes, which are the lowest and highest price of the security during the trading day. The <code>Latest</code> quote is the most recent price of the security available from the exchange market. The latest quote may not be the same as the close price.</p> <p>Figure 2. Historical prices on Yahoo Finance. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>Portfolio Performance uses the <code>Close</code> quote in its performance calculations. If there is a Latest quote available, it will be integrated in the Close price. For Bitcoins, the situation is more complex because they are traded 7/24. Portfolio Performance uses midnight (on the users system) to set the Close Quote. So, the historical quotes of a bitcoin could vary between users.</p> <p>Sometimes, the historical quotes are adjusted to reflect certain events that affect the value of the security, such as stock splits, dividends, or mergers. These are called the <code>Adjusted close</code> quotes. They are useful for comparing the long-term performance of the security, as they account for the changes in the number of shares or the amount of cash paid to the shareholders.</p> <p>There isn't a shortage of financial services that publish historical prices. However, most of them are rather expensive. Many also offer a so-called free account, but as the saying goes, if it is free, you are the customer.\" Finding good (precise, up-to-date) but free data sources for all your historical prices can be challenging. Portfolio Performance suggests, among others, Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, Quandl, which were once excellent solutions but have since changed their offerings and are not as useful anymore as free services. Their terms of use and, most importantly, their commitment in the long run often fall short. In practice, only Portfolio Report and Yahoo Finance can currently be recommended (Yahoo Finance has also placed the CSV download behind a paywall since late 2024). But see the how-to section for some tips &amp; tricks.</p> <p>Exchange markets (must) publish the historical quotes of the securities they trade. Several financial services such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and others provide historical quotes for different securities and exchange markets through their websites.</p> <p>There are two primary methods for obtaining financial data from the web: downloading a csv file, or using an API (Application Programming Interface) to get the data.</p> <p>Both methods start with a request to the financial service or website. A request is a message that contains the information and parameters needed to access the historical quote feed. A request is sent from the client, which is the user's device or application, to the server, which is the financial service or website. The server processes the request and sends back a response. The response could be a csv file, or a structured text (JSON or XML).</p> <p>In both cases, Portfolio Performance needs to map its internal fields, such as date and value of the quote, with the data in the response. If successfully, Portfolio Performance can use these fields then in its performance calculation.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>In theory, one could scrape webpages that contain tables with historical prices (see for example, Figure 2). Portfolio Performance supports this method; see Import HTML table. However, in practice, nowadays most service providers utilize JavaScript or another technology that hinders this scraping process.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/portfolio-performance-terminology/","title":"Portfolio Performance terminology","text":"<p>This page provides an overview of fundamental concepts and terminology used in Portfolio Performance.

Ten shares were purchased on 15 January 2021 for a total of 155 EUR (including fees and taxes), and 5 shares on 14 January 2022 for 84 EUR. Five shares were sold on 12 April 2023 for 105 EUR.  </p> <p>The historical prices for the 3-, 2-, and 1-year Reporting Periods are*14.705 EUR, 17.794 EUR, and 18.15 EUR/share, respectively.

The historical price of 18.15 EUR/share at the beginning of the period is used to value the security.  </p> <p>At the start of the period, 15 shares were in the portfolio, with a total value of 15 \u00d7 18.15 EUR = 272.25 EUR. During the period, 5 shares were sold.

Under the FIFO principl*, 5 shares are sold, leaving a remaining value of 177.94 / 2 = 88.97 EUR.  </p> <p>An additional 5 shares are purchased for 84 EUR. Thus, the total Purchase Value*for this period is 88.97 + 84 = 172.97 EUR.  </p> <p>The Purchase Price*is the weighted average of the first purchase valuation (17.794 EUR/share) and the second purchase (16 EUR/share), calculated as: (17.794 + 16) / 2 = 16.90 EUR/share.</p> <ul> <li>3-year Reporting Period</li> </ul> <p>Since all transactions occur within the Reporting Period, the actual purchase data are used.  </p> <p>The first purchase of 10 shares is valued at 155 EUR.

Concerning the IRR calculation equation, transactions made on the first date, e.g. July 4, 2023, should not be included in the equation, as they are already accounted for in the MVB of the period. Conversely, transactions on the last day of the period should be included in the equation, as they influence the MVE, even if for a very brief period.

For example, your portfolio starts at 100 EUR and grows to 104 EUR by the end of the period, resulting in a performance of + 4%. Equation 1 offers three versions of the base formula; also named the Simple Rate of Return (ROR) or Return on Investment (ROI).</p> <p>$$\\mathrm{r = \\frac{(MVE - MVB)}{MVB} \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad r = \\frac{MVE}{MVB} -1 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad MVB \\times (1 + r) = MVE \\quad (Eq  1)}$$</p> <p>where MVE = the market value of the investment at the end of the reporting period, and MVB = the market value of the investment at the beginning of the period. The Market Value (MV) of a deposit account refers to the total balance of the account on a particular date. For a security or a security account, such as stocks, the MV is calculated by multiplying the number of shares by the closing price. The MV of a portfolio is determined by summing the market values of all accounts on that specific date.</p> <p>Regarding Eq 1, please note that:</p> <ul> <li>The rate of return percentage applies to the entire period between MVE and MVB (3 years, 6 months, ...). It is not an annual rate.</li> <li>There are no additional transactions within the specified period. The MVE is solely influenced by the MVB and time.</li> <li>The equation can be applied to calculate the performance of the entire portfolio, a specific (security or deposit) account, an individual security, or a particular trade.</li> </ul> <p>To address the above concerns, Portfolio Performance employs two distinct approaches to calculate the rate of return when additional transactions occur within the reporting period: the money-weighted or time-weighted rate of return. It also differentiates between measuring performance on the portfolio, security, or trade level.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The simple Rate of Return (ROR) isn't adequate for describing the performance of a portfolio when transactions occur in the reporting period. Let's take the example from above. Your portfolio already contains one share valued at 100 EUR at the beginning of the year (MVB=100). Due to the favorable track record of the company issuing the shares, its price has increased to 104 EUR per share by the end of the year. Let's now compare the following scenarios:</p> <ul> <li>No additional transactions: You take no actions throughout the year. According to Equation 1, r = (104-100)/100 = 4%. This seems intuitively correct. You gained 4 EUR, which is 4% of the initial value.</li> <li>Additional transactions: You acquire  a second share at 100 EUR; right at the beginning of the year. MVB is still 100 EUR; while MVE becomes 2 * 104 = 208 EUR. The performance becomes a staggering 108% or (208-100)/100. This does not feel OK. You know that the growth rate of the company's share is 4%. Certainly, your total investment of 200\u20ac has gained 8 EUR or 4% on 200 EUR; but not on the MVB of 100 EUR.

However, let's consider the demo-portfolio-03 as an example (see Figure 2).</p> <p>Figure 2. Overview of transactions - Deposit (3x), Buy (3x), Dividend, and partial Sell and charts of share-1 and share-2. </p> <p>This portfolio has one deposit account <code>broker-A (EUR)</code>, and one security account <code>broker-A</code>, containing two securities <code>share-1</code> and <code>share-2</code>. Only four types of transactions are made: deposit, buy, dividend, and sell. The question is, what are the relevant cash flows in Equation 1 in this context? For instance, a deposit transaction will transfer money into the portfolio and the deposit account. A sell transaction will withdraw money from a security and security account and move it into a deposit account, but it does not affect the portfolio.</p> <p>Before defining the relevant cash flows, it is essential to determine the level at which performance calculation is required. Do you need to calculate the performance of the entire portfolio (and for which period), of a specific account or security, or of a particular trade?</p> <p>From the perspective of the portfolio, cash flows only occur when cash or securities are entering or leaving, the portfolio. Only four transaction types are relevant: <code>deposit</code>, <code>withdrawal</code>, <code>delivery in</code>, and <code>delivery out</code> (refer to Figure 3, on the left and right side).  Buy, sell, or dividend transactions do not create a portfolio cash flow. Money is not entering or leaving the portfolio; it is only moving between accounts within the portfolio.</p> <p>From the perspective of the security or security account only five transactions are relevant: <code>Buy</code>, <code>Sell</code>, <code>Dividend</code>, and also <code>Delivery In</code> and <code>Delivery Out</code>. These transactions will bring money into or out of the security (account). Some people may find it challenging to recognize that dividends are not portfolio cash flows. It may seem as though money is coming to the portfolio from an external source, similar to a deposit. However, the dividend is paid by a company to its shareholders as a distribution of profits. As a shareholder, you are essentially a partial owner, so the shares are paying the dividend themselves.</p> <p>From Figure 3, you may notice that the cash flow into or out of a security is represented differently than one entering or leaving the security account or portfolio (square versus circle). Consider the first Buy transaction of <code>share-1</code>. It is clear that the outflow from the deposit account is 155 EUR. This amount is used for raw capital purchase (150 EUR), fees (3 EUR), and taxes (2 EUR). So, how much is the inflow into the security (account)? There are four possibilities</p> <ul> <li>With fees and taxes (155 EUR): This amount is exactly what we actually pay for <code>share-1</code>. But, even if the share price increases slightly, the MVE will probably be less than the MVB with a negative performance as result  </li> <li>With fees only (153 EUR): The fact that we paid 2 EUR taxes shouldn't be taken into account. Tax collection varies significantly from country to country and is also outside our control. Some countries will collect taxes at purchase time (as in this case), some do it partly at purchase and partly later, and some collect at the time of selling. A case could be made to exclude taxes from the performance calculation.</li> <li>With taxes only (152 EUR): Fees are not taken into account; only taxes are. Although fees are also quite variable, they are more inherent to the purchase than taxes as they should reflect the real cost for the broker to carry out the transaction. Including taxes but disregarding fees is somewhat contradictory.</li> <li>Without fees and taxes (150 EUR): This is the value that the 10 shares were worth at the time of purchase. If the security (account) is worth more or less in the future, this is the number to compare with. In this view, fees and taxes should not be taken into account in performance calculations.</li> </ul> <p>It turns out that Portfolio Performance takes an in-between stance. For the calculation of the performance of the whole portfolio, fees and taxes are included (e.g., 155 EUR).

As <code>share-2</code> was acquired on September 30, 2022, its performance until that date registers as zero (indicated by the horizontal orange line). From that point onward, the performance of the total portfolio diverges from that of <code>share-1</code> due to the notably successful yet relatively minor contribution of <code>share-2</code> within the overall portfolio. As can be seen, the TTWROR of the entire portfolio (black line) ends at 25.58%, as calculated in Figure 3.</p> <p>Figure 5. Graph of the cumulative performance of portfolio, share-1, and share-2 (2 years period).</p> <p>For the manual calculation, you need to define the holding periods. This is fairly easy for <code>share-2</code>. One holding period should suffice: from just before the buying date until the end of the reporting period. The MVB of <code>share-2</code> at the beginning of the holding period (just before the buy) is 0 EUR. The MVE equals 111.76. The buy-transaction cost is 66 EUR (fees included; taxes excluded).

The total TTWROR for the entire reporting period is 14,80%; which is slightly less than the reported TTWROR from Portfolio Performance in Figure 4 (14,98%). This small difference is caused by the fact that in Eq 1assumes that all transactions are carried out at the beginning of the trading date, while Eq 3 assumes that cash outflows occur at the end of the trading day.

This focus contrasts with many proprietary broker apps, which primarily facilitate the technical execution of orders. The following text outlines the principal components (see figure 1). Follow the links to obtain more information about each component. An example with a simple portfolio can be found in a separate text.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/system-overview/#components","title":"Components","text":"<p>Figure 1. System overview with components and relations.</p> <p>Performance is a multi-layered concept. Not only are there several different methods to calculate it, such as money-weighted (IRR) and time-weighted (TTWROR) rates of return, but you can also calculate performance at various levels: the portfolio as a whole, a security or deposit account, an individual security, or a single trade. In its simplest form, without any transactions, the performance of a portfolio can be represented by the following equation (please refer to the links provided earlier for more detailed information):</p> <p>$$\\mathrm{r = \\frac{(MVE - MVB)}{MVB} \\quad (Eq  1)}$$</p> <p>where MVE = the market value of the portfolio at the end of the reporting period, and MVB = the market value of the portfolio at the beginning of the period.</p> <p>Performance is directly influenced by the reporting period, which is set by default to one year from today. The reporting period determines the value of the portfolio, account, or security at the beginning and end of the period (e.g. MVB and MVE in the performance equations). In the case of the money-weighted rate of return (IRR), it also determines the remaining duration that a cash flow has available to generate a profit or a loss at the end of the reporting period. </p> <p>Currency exchange rates have a more indirect influence and come into play whenever a transaction involves currency conversion. This includes transfers between different currency cash accounts and transactions such as buys, sells, and dividends in multiple currencies. For example, buying securities that are quoted in USD may require you to convert Euros to USD at a certain exchange rate. Upon selling these securities, you may need to convert the USD back to Euros. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the time of purchase and the time of sale can result in a profit or a loss, as the value of the USD in terms of Euros may have changed.</p> <p>Historical prices of securities significantly impact the market value and, consequently, the performance of the portfolio, security accounts, individual securities, and trades. It is clear that when a security's price is higher at the end of a trade compared to its price at the beginning, a profitable trade has been made. This price increase results in a capital gain, which directly contributes to the overall performance and value of the portfolio.</p> <p>Last but not least, performance is directly dependent on the portfolio and transactions. Without any transactions within the reporting period, the basic performance equation simplifies to IRR = TTWROR = (MVE/MVB) - 1. If the MVE is greater than MVB, a profit has been made, resulting in a positive performance. Conversely, if MVE is less than MVB, the portfolio is worth less at the end of the reporting period than at the beginning, leading to a negative performance.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/system-overview/#transactions","title":"Transactions","text":"<p>Things become more complicated when transactions occur during the reporting period. There are 13 types of transactions, each generating cash flows into and out of the portfolio, account, or security. Figure 2 illustrates all transaction types between the four major components: the portfolio (represented by a dashed blue line), deposit (cash) accounts in both EUR and USD, three securities (two of which are quoted in USD), and collected into two security accounts (orange and blue dashed lines). Security-2 (USD) is present in both accounts.</p> <p>Transactions are represented by arrows. They generate cash outflows (red circle) or cash inflows (green circle). The numbers next to the circles represent the magnitude of the cash flow, based on a hypothetical example of a buy or sell of 5 shares at 10 EUR/USD per share, resulting in a capital inflow of 50 EUR/USD. Fees and taxes are always set at 1 and 2 EUR respectively. A dividend of 2 USD is paid per share; an exchange rate of 0.9 EUR/USD is used.</p> <p>Figure 2. Overview of all transaction types with associated cash flows at portfolio, account and security level. </p> <p>As can be seen, only four types of transactions generate a cash flow at the portfolio level: deposit, removal (withdrawal), inbound delivery, and outbound delivery. These transactions will thus influence the performance indicator on the dashboard (View &gt; Reports &gt; Performance); which is a portfolio performance indicator. </p> <p>A deposit transaction generates two cash inflows: one at the portfolio level and one at the deposit account level. This transaction results in an inflow because money is brought into the deposit account, and as such also into the portfolio. On the other hand, a withdrawal creates two cash outflows and removes money from a cash account and the portfolio.</p> <p>An inbound delivery adds shares to a security; thus increasing the capital of the security (shares x historical price) and the security account. Conversely, an outbound delivery decreases the capital by removing shares from the security, resulting in a cash outflow.</p> <p>Special attention should be given to fees and taxes. The inbound delivery of 5 shares at 10 EUR per share will increase the capital by 50 EUR, but requires a 53 EUR inflow into the portfolio. However, the cash inflow into the security is 51 EUR, because the 1 EUR fee is only split off after the cashflow at the security boundary. To determine the cash inflow or outflow of a security, one should always incorporate the fees. Fees are considered intrinsic to the transaction, whereas taxes are not considered intrinsic to a security. Collecting taxes varies greatly per country, and the performance of a security should not depend on it. Taxes are by default excluded from the performance calculation at security level. Concerning the security account level, Portfolio Performance offers two possibilities: account performance before or after taxes (default calculation); see menu View &gt; Reports &gt; Chart &gt; configure chart &gt; Add data series ... The default After taxes calculation is shown in Figure 2. Upon crossing the security account border (second green circle), the taxes are already accounted for in the taxes component of the security. The cash inflow of the security account is thus 51 EUR. With the Before taxes calculation, the security account cash inflow is 53 EUR, because 2 EUR taxes are deposited into the taxes entity only after crossing the security account border.</p> <p>All other transactions are internal to the portfolio; they do not influence the portfolio's performance. For example, the transfer-out transaction is a flow between two deposit accounts and, as such, has no impact on the performance of the portfolio, except when there is a currency conversion as in the example of Figure 2. </p> <p>Suppose that you transfer 100 EUR at the very beginning of the reporting period at a conversion rate of 1.1 EUR/USD, giving you a deposit of 90.91 USD. The exchange rate changed to 0.9 EUR/USD at the end of the reporting period. Because the performance calculation is done in the currency of the portfolio, e.g., EUR, that 90.91 USD is valued at 81.82 EUR at the period end, resulting in a loss of about 18 EUR due to currency loss.</p> <p>A buy transaction closely mirrors a delivery inbound, except that the cash flow originates from inside the portfolio rather than from outside. From the perspective of the cash account, this resembles a cash outflow. The security and security account receive a cash inflow. For a discussion about fees and taxes, please refer to the earlier text.</p> <p>A sell transaction will result in a cash inflow into a deposit account (47 USD) because the 50 USD capital sell is reduced by taxes and fees.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>In terms of performance, a Buy/Sell versus Delivery Inbound/Outbound transaction can produce significantly different results. Only when a buy transaction is accompanied by a deposit transaction on the same day and for the same amount, there is no difference in performance between buy versus delivery. However, when a buy transaction is not accompanied by a corresponding deposit transaction, the cash balance in the relevant account will be reduced (and potentially become negative), which can have a negative impact on the market value at the end (MVE) of the account. </p> <p>A dividend can be viewed as a type of sell transaction. In Figure 2, the capital (5 shares) of security-2 (USD) will provide you with a dividend (gross amount) of 10 USD (5 shares x 2 USD/share). The fees are deducted, resulting in a security and security account outflow of 9 USD. After deducting the taxes and converting the remaining 7 USD to EUR, a +6.3 EUR cash inflow is received by deposit-account-1 (EUR).</p> <p>The separate fees, fees refund, taxes, and taxes refund transactions follow the same rules as outlined above. Therefore, it makes no difference whether you record taxes and fees as part of one buy, sell, or delivery transaction, or whether you split them off into a separate transaction.</p> <p>A special case is made by the interest and interest charge transactions. Although they do increase or decrease the cash balance of the deposit account, they do not generate any cash inflow or outflow. Just as the capital of a security can increase or decrease as a result of changing quotes (capital gain or loss), the balance of a deposit account can change due to interest.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/system-overview/system-overview-example/","title":"System overview example","text":"<p>The name PortfolioPerformance (PP) captures its purpose very well: managing an investment portfolio from a performance perspective.

Regarding the final balance of broker-A's securities account (129.13 EUR), on March 5, the account contains 5 shares of share-1, valued at 60 EUR, and 5 shares of share-2, valued at 75 USD. As the securities account's base currency is EUR, the USD value is converted to EUR using an exchange rate of 0.9217 USD/EUR, resulting in 69.13 EUR. This brings the total to EUR 129.13, representing the final balance of the securities account.</p> <p>Performance is calculated on a daily basis. To compute it, you need the market value of the asset at the beginning (MVB) and end (MVE) of the day, along with the total net amount of incoming and outgoing cash flows. With these values, one can calculate the daily performance using the equation provided in Figure 1 (see also reference &gt; view &gt; reports &gt; performance). These daily performances can then be used to determine the cumulative performance. Let's analyze and compare the performance of share-1, share-2, and the overall portfolio across different days.</p> <ul> <li>March 1<ul> <li>share-1: Since the shares are purchased during the day, the market Value at the Beginning of the day (MVB) is zero EUR. MVE is 100 EUR; 10 shares at closing price of 10 EUR per share. To buy the stock, a net cash inflow of 103 EUR is needed (to pay the principal and fees). Taxes are NOT considered. There are no cash outflows. The daily performance = [100/(0 + 103)] - 1 = -0.0291 or -2.91%.</li> <li>share-2: Allvalues are zero; the performance is also zero (technically, it should be undefined because you are dividing by zero).</li> <li>portfolio: The portfolio contains all securities and deposit accounts. The MVE of the portfolio is the market value of share-1 (100 EUR), plus what is left in the deposit account (195 EUR) or in total 295 EUR. The daily performance is thus [295/(0+300)] - 1 = -0.0167 or -1.67%.</li> </ul> </li> <li>March 2: there are no transactions, and the historical prices are stable. The daily performance is zero, and the cumulative performance stays at the same level for all assets.</li> <li>March 3<ul> <li>share-1: Nothing changes for share-1.</li> <li>share-2: The MVE of share-2 is 76 USD (5 x 15 USD/share) or 75 x 0.9248 = 69.36 EUR. The total cash inflow is the MVE + fees = 76 USD. The daily performance is thus [75/(0 + 76)] - 1 = -0.0132 or -1.32%. The cumulative performance = [(1+0) x (1+0) x (1 -0.0132)] -1 = -1.32%. </li> <li>portfolio: The MVE of the portfolio is the sum of the MVEs of the two shares, plus what is left in the deposit accounts: 100 + 69.36 + 120 + 2.87 (USD 3.10 x 0.9248) = 292.23 EUR. The daily performance is [292.23/(295+0)] - 1 = -0.0094 or -0.094%. The cumulative performance = [(1 - 0.0167) x (1 + 0) x (1 -0.0094)] -1 = -2.59%.</li> </ul> </li> <li>March 4<ul> <li>share-1: The capital gain and the dividend of share-1 positively impact both the daily and cumulative performance. The daily performance for share-1 is ((110 + 13)/100) -1 = 0.13 or 13%. The cumulative performance becomes: [(1-0.0291)x(1+0)x(1+0)x(1+0.23)] - 1= 19.42%.</li> <li>share-2: The MVE decreases to 5 x 13 USD = 65 USD or 65 x 0.9220 = 59.93 EUR. The daily performance is (59.93/69.36) - 1 = -13.6%. The cumulative performance = [(1+0) x (1+0) x (1 -0.0132) x (1-0.1360)] -1 = -14.74%. </li> <li>portfolio: The portfolio performance becomes also positive. The MVE = 110 (share-1) + 59.93 (share-2) + 128 (deposit account in EUR) + (76 USD  x 0.9220) or 300.79 EUR. The daily performance is thus (300.79/292.23) - 1 = 0.0293 or 2.93%. The cumulative performance is [(1-0.0167)x(1+0)x(1-0.0094)x(1+0.0293)] - 1= 0.26%.</li> </ul> </li> <li>March 5<ul> <li>share-1: There are 5 share-1 left. So, the MVE of share-1 is 5 x 12 = 60 EUR. But, 5 shares were sold: 5 x 12 minus fees = 55 EUR. The daily performance is [(60 + 55)/110] - 1 = 4.55%. The cumulative performance of share-1 is [(1-0.0291)x(1+0)x(1+0)x(1+0.23)x (1+0.0455)] - 1= 24.85%.</li> <li>Share-2: Profits too from a capital gain. The MVE becomes 5 x 15 = 75 or 69.13 EUR. The daily performance is (69.13/59.93) - 1 = 15.35%. The cumulative performance of share-1 is [(1+0)x(1+0)x(1-0.0132)x(1-0.1360)x(1+0.1535)] - 1= -1.65%; slightly negative, due to the capital loss on March 4.</li> <li>Portfolio: The MVE of the portfolio = 60 (share-1) + 69.13 (share-2) + 177 (deposit account in EUR) + (3.10 USD x 0.9217 = 2.86) or 308.99 EUR.  The daily performance is thus (308.99/300.79) - 1 = 0.0273 or 2.73%. The cumulative performance is [(1-0.0167)x(1+0)x(1-0.0094)x(1+0.0293)x(1+0.0273)] - 1 = 3.00%.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>To track, evaluate, and manage your securities, Portfolio Performance needs the basic data about your securities accounts and past transactions.

Key performance and risk indicators for the entire portfolio are summarized in a dashboard, accessible through the menu <code>View &gt; Reports &gt; Performance</code> or via the sidebar (see Figure 1). A comprehensive review of the dashboard is available in the Reference Manual under <code>View &gt; Performance</code>. As always, green values indicate a profit, while red signifies a loss.</p> <p>Figure 1. Dashboard with key performance indicators - 2-year reporting period.</p> <p>To follow along with the text and Figure 1, download the demo-portfolio-03 file. Select the 2-year reporting period (top right) from <code>2021-06-12</code> \u2192 <code>2023-06-12</code>. This implies that your portfolio already contained some stock by June 12, 2021. We begin by examining the Calculation Widget (on the right side).</p> <ul> <li>Initial value This is the market value of the portfolio at the beginning of the reporting period (MVB), e.g. 177.94 EUR. On that day, your portfolio held 10 <code>share-1</code> shares valued at 17.79 EUR per share, totaling 177.94 EUR (look here for an overview of all transactions in the demo portfolio). Please note, that the historical price of the stock on that day is taken, not the original buying price.</li> <li>Final value This is the market value of the portfolio at the end of the reporting period; e.g. 426.82 EUR. To verify the final value, navigate to <code>sidebar &gt; Reports &gt; Performance &gt; Calculation</code> and click on the <code>Assets at End</code> heading tab. The deposit account shows 125 EUR from deposit, buy, dividend, and sell transactions. <code>share-1</code> is valued at 190.06 EUR (10 remaining shares x 19.06), and <code>share-2</code> at 111.76 (8 shares x 13.97). In total, this sums to 426.62 EUR, representing the <code>Final (market) value</code> of your portfolio on June 12, 2023. </li> <li>Performance neutral Transfers These are the deposits or withdrawals (removals) that do not affect the performance of the portfolio. For example,  the deposit of 84 EUR (additional <code>share-1</code>), and 67 EUR (<code>share-2</code>) are neutralized by buying both securities. Note that the original deposit and purchase of <code>share-1</code> (155 EUR) is not included because it fell outside the reporting period.</li> <li>Capital Gains represent the increase (or decrease) of the value of your stock between begin and end of the reporting period. Determining the buying value of <code>share-1</code> is somewhat complex due to the additional buy and sale. Portfolio Performance follows the FIFO (First-In-First-out) principle. From the remaining 10 shares, 5 will come from the first purchase and 5 from the second purchase. The historical quote at the first purchase date was 17.794 EUR/share and at the second purchase data 15.962 given an average price of (17.794 + 15.962)/2 = 16.878 EUR. The final market value is 19.006 EUR given a capital gain of 10 x (19.006-16.878) = 21.28 EUR. The value of <code>share-2</code> has increased from 8 EUR (on 2022-09-30) to 13.97 (on 2023-06-12) or a capital gain of 8 x 5.97 = 47.76 EUR. Added together, this gives a total Capital Gain of 69.04 EUR.</li> <li>Realized Capital Gains result from selling stock. On <code>2023-04-12</code>, you sold 5 <code>share-1</code> shares at 22.40 EUR per share. Given the FIFO principle, the buying price was 17.794 EUR per share, producing a Realized Capital Gain of 5 x (22.40 - 17.794) = 23.03 EUR.</li> <li>Earnings are caused by dividend payments (15 x 2 = 30 EUR), while Fees and Taxes encompass all fees and taxes incurred in the reporting period. Keep in mind that fees and taxes were also paid for the purchase of <code>share-1</code>, outside the reporting period.</li> </ul> <p>The first column of the dashboard lists the performance key indicators. We start with the more easily comprehended <code>Absolute change</code> and <code>Delta</code>.</p> <ul> <li>Absolute Change The difference between the final and initial value; e.g. 426.82 - 177.94 = 248.88 EUR. In this case, you earned a profit: your portfolio is more worth than it was in the beginning. Note that this profit includes the investments or external cash inflows you made to buy additional shares.</li> <li>Delta (for the reporting period) is equal to the <code>Absolute Change</code> minus the <code>Performance neutral Transfers</code>, resulting in 97.88 EUR. You might be tempted to think that Delta should be equal to the sum of all sub calculations (Capital Gains + Realize Capital Gains + ...). As you may noted however, the numbers in the calculation panel do not add up; e.g. Final value &lt;&gt; Initial value + ... Otherwise, you would have counted some elements twice. For example, the result of the dividend and sale is put on a deposit account and as such already included in both the Realized Capital Gains and Earnings and also in Performance Neutral Transfers.</li> <li>Internal Rate of Return (IRR) stands at 17.63%. This is the annual interest rate required to bring the initial market value of 177.94 EUR and all subsequent cash flows of 151 EUR to the final market value of 426.82 EUR. Therefore, the IRR is a percentage illustrating how well your portfolio performs, considering when and how much money you've invested or withdrawn (more info here).</li> <li>Cumulative True Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TTWOR) is 25.58%. It represents the growth rate of your portfolio from 177.94 EUR to 426.82 EUR, excluding external cash flows. TTWOR measures the growth of your investments without being influenced by the timing and size of your contributions or withdrawals (more info here).</li> <li>Last Day is the absolute change in the market value of the portfolio between today and the previous trading day before 'today'. As such, the value from Figure 1 will probably be different from the value you see in your demo-portfolio-03 file.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/rebalancing/","title":"Define portfolio strategy and rebalancing","text":"<p>By defining a strategy and goal, investors can avoid emotional reactions to market fluctuations and stay focused on their long-term plans.

Fees and taxes can be registered as usual.</p> <p>The bond depicted in Figure 1 matures on October 1, 2027, with an annual interest rate of 2.25%, payable each year on October 1. Since you acquired the bond on October 27 (value day), there have already been 26 days of accrued interest. At a rate of 2.25%, this amounts to 5000 EUR * 2.25% * 26/365, or 8.01 EUR. You have to pay this accrued interest at the purchase date to the seller, but you will get it back on the first interest payment on October 1, 2023.</p> <p>To process the accrued interest correctly, there are a few options; (see discussion on forum for a few variants).</p> <ol> <li> <p>Adapt the buying price.

These financial instruments aim to replicate the performance of the gold price by holding physical gold in a secure vault.

With a choice dividend, shareholders are given the option to choose between receiving cash payment (cash dividend) or additional shares of stock (stock dividend).</p>"},{"location":"how-to/handling-choice-dividend/#example-nn-group","title":"Example NN Group","text":"<p>For example, the Dutch financial services company, NN Group provided its shareholders with the option to receive the interim dividend for 2023 of 1.12 EUR per share, either in cash or in shares. The ex-dividend date was set on August 31, 2023, with the dividend payment scheduled for September 25, 2023. The reference share price was determined at 36.2513 EUR by taking the average of five daily historical prices between 12 and 18 September 2023 on Euronext Amsterdam between 12 and 18 September 2023.</p> <p>With this reference price the distribution ratio was established at 1-for-32.37 shares. Indeed, to receive one share of 36.2513 EUR, you need 32.37 shares x 1.12 EUR dividend.</p> <p>Theoretically, the cash and stock dividend options should lead to the same gross result. Otherwise, shareholders would naturally gravitate towards the more advantageous choice. Let's consider a scenario where you hold 100 shares of the NN group at the ex-date. Opting for the cash dividend would yield 100 shares x 1.12 = 112 EUR gross. On the other hand, choosing the stock dividend would grant you approximately 3.09 shares (100 shares / 32.37), valued at 36.2513 EUR per share. This totals around 112.02 EUR gross, which is approximately equivalent to the cash dividend amount. Please note that fractional shares are not always possible; although Portfolio Performance can easily work with them. So a solution for the .09 shares may need to be found.</p> <p>Of course, your choice will be influenced by your need for immediate liquidity (prompting for cash dividend) and your desire to further invest in this company (stock dividend).</p> <p>Although theoretically equivalent in terms of the gross value, factors such as fees, taxes, and various fiscal and broker regulations will impact the final net amount of cash retained. In practice the choices do differ. For example, a Belgian (thus, foreign) shareholder with 100 shares will receive 68.12 EUR of cash dividend, while the stock dividend is valued at 72.93 EUR; approximately 7% more. This difference is primarily caused by the elimination of foreign taxes in the case of stock dividend.</p> <p>Note</p> <ol> <li> <p>If you opt for cash dividend. You receive a Gross Amount of 100 x 1.12 = 112 EUR. The net value depends on the fiscal and broker regulations of your country. For example, as a Belgian shareholder, you pay 10% foreign taxes (=11.2 EUR), 30.24 EUR or 30% domestic taxes on the remaining value (112 - 11.2 = 100.8), 2.44 EUR or 2% broker fees + TVA 21%. The remaining net value is 100.8 - 30.24 - 2.44 = 68.12 EUR.</p> </li> <li> <p>You choose for stock dividend. The calculation becomes much more complex. Your broker need to solve the fractional share and you have to decide about the valuation of the newly acquired shares.</p> <ul> <li>You are entitled to 100/32.37 = 3.0893 shares. So, you will receive three new shares and your broker will convert the fraction (.0893) to a cash dividend. In this case, the closest approximation is two shares; 32.37 x 0.0893 = 2.89 or rounded down (!) two shares.</li> <li>The cash dividend follows the same rules as above. In this case, the Belgian broker does not charge a fee. The net cash dividend is thus 2 x 1.12 minus 10% foreign taxes and 30% domestic taxes = 1.41 EUR.</li> <li>From the point of view of the (Belgian) government, the acquirement of 3 shares is the result of the dividend payment of the NN group. The total of all taxes is <ul> <li>30% of domestic taxes are withheld = 32.63 EUR</li> <li>no foreign taxes because of the double-treaty between Belgium and The Netherlands</li> <li>Stock exchange tax of 0.35% or 1.78 EUR.</li> <li>TVA of 21% on the broker's fee: 0.74 EUR.</li> </ul> </li> <li>From the broker's point of view, you buy 3 shares. The total fees amount is apparently a fixed 3.5 EUR.</li> <li>Rests the difficult question of valuation of the three newly acquired bonus shares. How much are they worth at dividend payment date? <ul> <li>You could take the historical close price of the NN share on payment day: 3 x 36.33 EUR/share or 108.99 EUR.</li> <li>You could also take the reference price which will lead to the total amount of 3 x 36.25 = 108.7632.</li> <li>Because the close price on the payment day isn't very different from the reference price (36.33 vs 36.25), both valuations will be practically the same here.</li> </ul> </li> <li>So, how much did you really receive from this stock dividend?<ul> <li>net dividend of the remaining shares: 1.41 EUR.</li> <li>net price of the three newly acquired shares: 108.73 - 33.74 (taxes) - 3.5 (fees) = 71.52 EUR.</li> <li>Total net value: 72.93 EUR.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Certainly, the calculation above applies only for a Belgian shareholder with a particular broker in 2024. The advantage of the stock dividend is primarily due to the foreign tax situation, which may differ significantly for shareholders in other countries, particularly Dutch shareholders.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>Note that in the case of cash dividend, you will receive money, while with the stock dividend, you have to invest additional money.

As the main guide to importing securities explains, there are no mandatory fields for a securities import, but one of the descriptors of the security (Ticker Symbol, ISIN, WKN or Security Name) will be needed or you will be importing nothing.</p> <p>For the purposes of this guide we will be assuming we want to use Yahoo! Finance (YF from now on) later for our historical quotes (prices) and will focus on that case. If you plan to use a different provider of historical quotes, it will be worth looking into what ticker symbol or other identifier (e.g. ISIN, WKN) that source uses and including it at this stage. The YF ticker symbols are really only used by YF. To make things more complex, YF does use some more generic symbols sometimes. You can see this in the example below for VWRP.L, EQIX and GILG.L.</p> <p>So the information in this CSV will consist of (at a minimum): Ticker Symbol, Currency.</p> <p>It is worth adding Security Name while you're at it. Like this:</p> <p>Figure 1. Securities Import spreadsheet example. </p> <p>The figure above shows an example of a spreadsheet with a number of securities defined. This can be saved as a comma-separated values (CSV) file for import into PP.</p> <p>Follow the main Securities Import guide for how to import the file.</p> <p>Explanation</p> <p>It is worth getting the list of all the securities you want to use across all Securities Accounts together with the Ticker Symbol of your chosen provider of historical quotes (prices) and the security's currency (e.g. GBP, USD, GBp/GBX). If you will be using YF for your historical prices, it is unlikely your broker export will provide the Yahoo! Ticker symbol so you will need to add this.</p> <p>YF's portfolio tools can be helpful here as it is possible to create a list of securities by searching for each one and adding it to a portfolio. You can create a view of that portfolio showing the information needed above. See example below:</p> <p>Figure 2. Example Yahoo! Finance portfolio view. </p> <p>Unfortunately the YF export function does not respect the view you created. Instead, select the data from your browser and then copy and paste into a spreadsheet. When pasting, select to paste as text only.</p> <p>If using this route it will be necessary to change YF's symbol for pence (GBp) to PP's symbol (GBX). But a simple (but remember case-sensitive) Find/Replace can do that. In the example below, the column names have been changed to match what is required by Portfolio Performance and GBp has been replaced by GBX.</p> <p>It is worth reiterating a point made in the main Import guide. The currency column should be named \"Transaction Currency\". This is despite Portfolio Performance calling it \"Currency\" in the Import wizard. If you label the column \"Currency\" it will not be automatically selected for import (you will see that the column is not green in the Import Wizard). It is simple to select the column heading in the Import Wizard however if needed.</p> <p>The name \"Transaction Currency\" may confuse. When you actually buy and sell, your broker platform will probably do everything in GBP not GBX, so it may seem odd that the Transaction Currency is being defined here in GBX. What is really meant is the denomination of the security for pricing/quotes. Portfolio Performance needs to understand what currency the price/quote it receives from a provider is in.</p> <p>Figure 3. Example Securities CSV import created from a copy/paste from Yahoo!

This new entity becomes a distinct, standalone company with its own management, operations, and often its own publicly traded stock.</p> <p>The shareholders of the original company may receive shares in the new entity in proportion to their holdings in the parent company. A distribution ratio determines how many shares of the new entity each shareholder receives for every share held in the original company.</p> <p>On December 10, 2021, Daimler AG successfully executed a spin-off, resulting in the establishment of a new entity known as Daimler Truck Holding AG. Simultaneously, the former Daimler AG underwent a name change to become Mercedes-Benz Group AG. Consequently, the XETRA stock exchange market now encompasses two distinct securities: ISIN DE0007100000 for Mercedes-Benz (formerly Daimler AG) and ISIN DE000DTR0CK8 for Daimler Truck Holding AG. The distribution ratio for this spin-off was 2:1, signifying that for every two shares of Daimler AG, shareholders received one share of Daimler Truck Holding AG.</p> <p>Figure 1. Quote evolution of the Daimler Truck Holding and Mercedes-Benz Group. </p> <p>To record a spin-off in Portfolio Performance (PP), a suggested workflow, deduced from an in-depth discussion on the Portfolio Performance forum, involves the following steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Change the name of the security Daimler AG into Mercedes-Benz AG and create a new security Daimler Truck Holding AG in your portfolio.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a dividend transaction for the Mercedes security on December 10, 2021.

For example, there was a noticeable decline in the share price of the old Daimler AG, dropping from approximately \u20ac90 in mid-November 2021 to \u20ac74 on December 10, 2021, suggesting market anticipation of the impending spin-off.</p>"},{"location":"how-to/recording-stock-split/","title":"Recording a stock split","text":"<p>A stock split increases the number of shares in a company. For instance, following a 2-for-1 split, each investor will possess double the number of shares, and each share will be valued at half its previous price. A stock split leads to a reduction in the market price of individual shares but does not alter the total market capitalization of the company. Stock splits are frequently executed to make shares more accessible to a broader range of investors and enhance market liquidity. Conversely, a reverse stock split (1-for-5) entails fewer stock shares but at a higher price.</p> <p>There are essentially two methods for recording a stock split in PP: using the built-in function or a sell-buy-back operation.

Essentially, it retroactively assumes that the shares have always been split. This ensures the correct number of securities in the portfolio after the split and maintains historically consistent cash flows and valuations, thereby preserving the security's performance. However, the number of shares before the split may not align with the real historical situation, potentially complicating the understanding of the security's history.</p> <p>This change is destructive. It is not easily undone. If necessary, an improperly executed split can be corrected by executing a split with an inverse ratio.

Very noticeable, there is a massive drop between June 3 and 6, 2022. On those dates, the closing prices were <code>$ 2447</code> and <code>$ 124.79</code>, respectively (but remember, you own 20 times more shares).</p> <p>Figure 1.

But, while your purchase price around January 2022 was <code>$ 3408</code> (Figure 1), it appears to be priced around <code>$ 150</code> (Figure 2), according to investing.com. This discrepancy arises because financial websites typically \"adjust\" all historical prices after a stock split. This adjustment involves recalculating the historical prices before the split, just as the PP's Stock Split function does.</p> <p>Figure 3. Historical Quotes chart of Amazon (adjusted prices after stock split - chart from PP). </p> <p>Important</p> <p>The regular Yahoo Finance Close Price is already adjusted for splits. The Adjusted close price is en surplus adjusted for splits and dividend and/or capital gain distributions.</p> <p>Some considerations</p> <ul> <li> <p>The built-in stock split function perfectly mirrors the approach adopted by most financial websites. This results in the Adjusted prices chart (Figure 3) being identical to those displayed on other platforms like investing.com or Yahoo Finance (Figure 2).</p> </li> <li> <p>It's crucial to recognize that the historical transactions and prices are permanently altered. This means that PP's records of past transactions will no longer accurately reflect the actual transactions as documented in your paper files. Over time, this may complicate the reconstruction of a security's history.</p> </li> <li> <p>A notable challenge arises when a split results in fractional shares, as seen in the case of Prosus' split announcement on September 14, 2023, with a ratio of 2.1796-for-1. In this scenario, 10 existing shares would be split into 21.796 shares. While Portfolio Performance can handle fractional shares, most brokers or banks cannot. Typically, they would adapt to this particular situation by issuing 21 new shares and providing compensation for the fractional share (0.796 shares in this case). Consequently, after the split, you'll need to record this compensation, which essentially involves executing a sell transaction of the fraction.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"how-to/recording-stock-split/#use-of-sell-buy-back-operation","title":"Use of sell-buy-back operation","text":"<p>An alternative method that keeps the historical prices and transactions intact is the following sell-buy-back procedure.

If there is a remainder, sell it at the same price as described in step 2.</li> </ul> <p>Let's apply this workflow to a simplified example (see Figure 4). On 1 January 2021, you owned one share priced at 100 EUR. This price remained essentially unchanged until 31 December 2021. On 1 January 2022, a 10-for-1 stock split occured, resulting in 10 shares. The price at the end of the day was 11 EUR. By the end of the year, the price had increased to 13 EUR per share, giving your portfolio a market value of 130 EUR.</p> <p>Figure 4. Simplified example of sell-back-back stock split. </p> <p>The performance calculation for the built-in stock split function is quite straightforward. Due to the retroactive nature of the split function, the original purchase of 1 share at 100 EUR/share (MVB) is adjusted to reflect the purchase of 10 shares at 10 EUR/share. At the end of the two-year reporting period, you still own 10 shares, but their total value has increased to 130 EUR (MVE). Using the formulas from the money-weighted (IRR) and time-weighted (TTWROR) section:</p> <ul> <li>IRR: <code>130 = 100 * (1 + IRR)^2</code> or <code>IRR = SQRT(130/100) - 1</code> = 14.0157%.</li> <li>TTWROR: <code>= (130/100) - 1</code> or TTWROR = 30%</li> </ul> <p>When using the sell-buy-back method, you need to include supplementary transactions after the initial purchase. At the split date (2022-01-01), you sell 1 share at the price of 110 EUR/share and buy 10 shares at the price of 11 EUR/share. </p> <ul> <li>IRR: <code>130 = 100 * (1 + IRR)^(730/365) - 100 * (1 + IRR)^(365/365) + 100 * (1 + IRR)^(365/365)</code>. Because the last two terms cancel each other out, the formula simplifies to that of the built-in split, and <code>IRR = SQRT(130/100) - 1</code> or 14.0157%. It is crucial that the buy and sell transactions occur on the same day;  otherwise the second and third term are not equal. Suppose that you sell the 1 share on December 31 instead of January 1. The formula from above becomes <code>130 = 100 x (1+IRR)^(730/365) - 100 x (1+IRR)^(366/365) + 100 x (1+IRR)^(365/365)</code> or <code>IRR = 14.0355%</code> slightly higher than the result of the built-in function. Note that the negative second term has a slightly larger exponent, which means the IRR must be marginally higher to yield the MVE of 130 EUR.</li> <li>TTWROR <code>= ((110/100) x (130/110)) - 1</code> or <code>(1.1 x 1.1818) - 1 = 30%</code>. The exact selling date is unimportant for the TTWROR calculation.</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>For the buy and sell transactions, we used the share price immediately before the split.  However, according to the IRR and TWROR formulas mentioned earlier, the specific price used is not crucial, as long as the same price is applied for both the sell and buy transactions. The advantage of using the price from just before the split is that the closed trade (from the sell transaction) accurately reflects the share\u2019s real performance up to the split.</p> <p>Please note that in the View &gt; Reports &gt; Performance &gt; Trades view, all reported performances are independent of the reporting period, but reflect the real holding periods of the trades.

To access these historical prices through the API, users can send HTTP requests to specific API endpoints, specifying parameters such as date ranges, stock symbols, and any other relevant filters. The API endpoint (=server) processes these requests, retrieves the requested historical price data from its database, and returns the information in a structured format, often JSON or XML.</p> <p>For example, the following endpoint URL can be used to request the historical quotes of Apple between 2024-01-15 and 2024-01-17 from the <code>eod historical data</code> website.</p> <p><code>https://eodhd.com/api/eod/AAPL?from=2024-01-15&amp;to=2024-01-17&amp;period=d&amp;api_token=demo&amp;fmt=json</code></p> <p>As of January, 2024, the demo API token or key provided is still valid.

A list is an ordered collection of elements between [ ]. These can be accessed by their position. An object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs between { }. A key is a unique identifier for a value, and a value can be any type of data, such as a number, a string, a boolean, a list, or an object. A JSON response is a hierarchical structure, meaning that a list can contain other lists or objects, and an object can contain other lists or objects.</p> <p>To access a specific value within this hierarchical structure, you need to specify the path from the root to the element. To access an element from a list, you need to use its index, which is a number that indicates its position in the list. The index starts from 0 for the first element. To access an element from an object, you need to use its key, which is a string that indicates its name in the object. The key is enclosed in double quotes \" \".</p> <p>A query language such as JSONPath (used by PP) represents the root of the JSON response with a $ symbol. To separate the elements in the path, you need to use a dot. For example, to access the close price on the second day, you need to use the path <code>$[1].close</code>. This means that you start from the root $, then go to the second element in the list <code>$[1]</code>, which is an object, then go to the value with the key \"close\" in the object <code>$[1].close</code>, which is a number.</p> <p>You need this JSON path to complete PP's JSON Quote Feed Provider. Use the following parameters to retrieve the historical quotes (see also Figure 1). For an explanation of the meaning of different quote prices, please check Concepts &gt; Historical Prices.</p> <p>Figure 1.

Go to the \"Network\" tab and press the clear button which looks like a bin; again, not necessary but makes things easier. Now press the \"chart settings\" button just above the chart, click \"display options\", and then click the \"percentage\" button - this switches the chart to show the actual fund price, rather than a percentage change, and handily for our purposes causes the Morningstar website to request a link that we can use in Portfolio Performance with a bit of modification. That link should display in the \"network\" screen of the browser's developer tools, so now right-click on the entry that comes from the \"tools.morningstar.co.uk 44\" domain and is of type \"json\" and select the Copy-&gt;Copy URL option. The link should be</p> <p></p><pre><code>https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/api/rest.svc/timeseries_price/\nt92wz0sj7c?currencyId=GBP&amp;idtype=Morningstar&amp;frequency=daily&amp;\nstartDate=2011-02-01&amp;priceType=&amp;outputType=COMPACTJSON&amp;\nid=F00000ZB0M]2]0]FOGBR$$ALL&amp;applyTrackRecordExtension=true\n</code></pre> You now need to change some options in the link and slightly simplify it as well so it becomes: <pre><code>https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/api/rest.svc/timeseries_price/\nt92wz0sj7c?currencyId=GBP&amp;idtype=Morningstar&amp;frequency=daily&amp;\noutputType=JSON&amp;startDate=2020-12-31&amp;id=F00000ZB0M]2]0]\nFOGBR$$ALL\n</code></pre> <p>You can go to this link in your browser if you want to see the data.

The order of the options doesn't matter, but I find it easier to put the id at the end for when I'm setting up multiple securities.</p> <p>Now in Portfolio Performance select JSON as the provider in the \"Historical Quotes\" tab of the security, and use the following values (see also figure 1):</p> <pre><code>Feed URL = the link just created\nPath to Date = $.TimeSeries.Security[*].HistoryDetail[*].EndDate\nPath to Close = $.TimeSeries.Security[*].HistoryDetail[*].Value\n</code></pre> <p>Figure 1.

You can buy and sell cryptocurrencies, but you cannot have a deposit account denominated in a cryptocurrency.</p> <p>The popular CoinGecko website is the source of the cryptocurrencies, listed in Figure 7. You can use the Search box to look-up a specific cryptocurrency in this very long list. If the crypto you need is not listed, you should create a new empty security; remember cryptos are no different from securities in PP.

Used notably in the Taxonomies menu to visualize portfolio asset distribution and classifications.</p> </li> <li> <p>jsoup Java HTML Parser   A powerful, user-friendly HTML and XML parser library. Portfolio Performance uses jsoup to scrape historical price data and other relevant information from financial websites by parsing real-world web pages, even if they are poorly formatted.</p> </li> <li> <p>JSON.simple   A lightweight Java toolkit to encode and decode JSON text. Essential for handling data downloads from JSON APIs, such as retrieving historical price feeds and other online data sources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)   Google's efficient, language- and platform-neutral serialization mechanism. Portfolio Performance uses protobuf to convert the portfolio\u2019s XML-based data structures into optimized Java objects for faster access and manipulation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Guava   Google's core Java libraries extension. Guava provides immutable collections, caching utilities, advanced concurrency libraries, and other utilities that make the codebase more robust and developer-friendly.</p> </li> <li> <p>JsonPath   A query language for JSON, inspired by XPath for XML. Portfolio Performance uses JsonPath to extract specific pieces of information efficiently from large JSON documents.</p> </li> <li> <p>D3.js   Although primarily a JavaScript library for creating dynamic, interactive data visualizations on the web, D3.js is used within Portfolio Performance's reporting components (e.g., Portfolio Report) to generate rich, web-based charts and graphs embedded in the app.</p> </li> <li> <p>XStream   Serializes and deserializes Java objects to XML and JSON formats.

Transaction menu. </p> <p>In PortfolioPerformance (PP), a transaction represents an operation that alters the state of a portfolio; for example, a deposit will increase a deposit account. As depicted in Figure 1, there are 15 transaction types. <code>Security transfer ...</code> and <code>Transfer between accounts ...</code> deviate slightly from the others and only appear when there is more than one security and/or deposit account. The transactions can be grouped into pairs of operations that have opposite effects:</p> <ul> <li>Buy/sell: Buying an asset will increase the value of a security account and decrease a deposit account, whereas selling an asset will have the reverse effect.</li> <li>Delivery (inbound/outbound): Inbound delivery will add securities to a security account, while outbound delivery will remove them. The deposit account remains unaffected.</li> <li>Deposit/Removal (or withdrawal): Depositing or withdrawing funds will respectively increase or decrease the value of a deposit account.</li> <li>Interest/Interest charge: Receiving interest entails an increase in a deposit account, whereas paying interest leads to a decrease.</li> <li>Fees/Fees refund:Paying a fee entails a withdrawal from a deposit account, while receiving a refund involves a deposit.</li> <li>Taxes/Taxes Refund: Taxes are settled by withdrawing funds from a deposit account; conversely, a tax refund results in a deposit into the account. </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>In theory, Portfolio Performance could suffice with 8 transaction types: trade, delivery, deposit, fees, taxes, interest, transfer, and dividend. Each transaction could be expressed with a positive or negative value, for example: sell or trade(-) and buy or trade (+).</p> <p>In fact, this is suggested by the fact, that the type of a transaction could be changed in a table such as <code>All Transactions</code> by double clicking on the keyword (e.g. Buy) and choosing the alternative from the drop down (sell, delivery inbound, delivery outbound). This technique doesn't work with fees and taxes.    </p> <p>Figure 2 illustrates the effect of all 15 transaction types on the deposit and securities account. Analyzing Figure 2 will clarify the impact that each transaction type has on a portfolio.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Security accounts are exclusively impacted by buy, sell, delivery (inbound &amp; outbound), and Security Transfer transactions. This likely explains why they are grouped together with a divider line (see figure 1). It's important to note that while a buy/sell transaction affects both deposit and security accounts, delivery and security transfer transactions do not. A delivery is essentially a buy/sell transaction without the involvement of deposits and is represented as originating from outside the portfolio.</p> </li> <li> <p>All transaction types, except delivery and security transfer (see above), will affect the deposit account. These effects could manifest as inflows (green color) or outflows (red color).</p> </li> <li> <p>The coloring scheme might be a bit confusing. In the image on the left side of Figure 2 (from the <code>All Securities</code> view), a buy transaction results in an outflow from the deposit account; yet it's depicted in green. Conversely, a transfer (from one security/deposit account to another) is depicted in red.</p> </li> <li> <p>With the exception of interest, all transaction types are associated with a specific security, such as a share. Interest, on the other hand, is only linked to a deposit account. One implication of this is that interest on bonds should be recorded as a dividend in Portfolio Performance if you wish to maintain the connection with the bond.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Figure 2.

It's important to note that this value is fixed at the end of the day, meaning transactions from the first day are not included. You can verify the Initial Value and its components in the Assets at Start panel (Figure 3). In terms of our performance equations, the MVB symbol (Market Value Begin) refers to this value.</p> <p>Figure 3. Assets at Start panel. </p> <p>Between Initial and Final Value are the different categories of changes that lead from the former to the latter: Capital Gains, Earnings, Fees and Taxes, Cash Currency Gains, and Performance Neutral Transfers (see Figure 1).</p> </li> <li> <p>Capital Gains: A capital gain or loss refers to the increase or decrease in the value of a capital asset, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate, between the time it is purchased and the time it is valued or sold. In the latter case, the term \"Realized Capital Gain\" is used. For each security remaining in the portfolio, the absolute gain or loss is calculated. It is important to stress that the gain or loss is expressed in the portfolio's currency; not the currency of the asset. If the asset is denominated in a foreign currency, any gain or loss due to fluctuations in the exchange rate is accounted for and indicated in the column <code>thereof foreign currency gains</code>. Hovering with the mouse over the value will display a pop-up with a more detailed calculation. For example, take the calculation of <code>share-3</code> (see Figure 1 - information pane):</p> <ul> <li>Jan 1, 2023: considering an exchange rate of 1 EUR = 1.5693 AUD (~0.6372 AUD/EUR), purchase of 5 shares (share-3) at 20 AUD/share = 100 AUD x 1/1.5693 = 63.72 EUR.</li> <li>December 31, 2023: considering an exchange rate of 1 EUR = 1.6263 AUD (~0.6149 AUD/EUR), valuation of 5 shares at 15 AUD/share = 75 AUD x 1/1.6263 = 46.12 EUR.</li> <li>Capital loss = 46.12 - 63.72 = -17.60 EUR.</li> </ul> <p>However, this loss is exacerbated by the change in the exchange rate. The 100 AUD purchased on Jan 1, 2023, were valued at 63.72 EUR, whereas on December 31, 2023, they were valued at only 61.49 EUR. Thus, quote price remaining unchanged, your investment (expressed in EUR) decreased already by -2.23 EUR due to the difference in the exchange rate. The total capital loss of -17.60 EUR is partly caused to the currency exchange loss of -2.23 EUR.</p> </li> <li> <p>Realized Capital Gains: refer to the profit or loss that occurs when an investment is sold for a price different from its original purchase price. The hypothetical capital gains or losses, as described above are then realized. There is only one realized capital gain in Figure 1. On April 12, 2023, 5 shares of <code>share-1</code> are sold for 5 x 22.40 EUR/share = 112 EUR (excluding fees and taxes). At the time of MVB (December 31, 2022), they were valued at 5 x 18.638 EUR/share = 93.19 EUR. The realized capital gain is thus 112 - 93.19 = 18.81 EUR. It's worth noting that <code>share-1</code> was purchased in two batches: 10 shares on January 15, 2021, at 15 EUR/share and 5 shares on January 14, 2022, at 16 EUR/share. Due to the FIFO principle that Portfolio Performance implements, the 5 shares that were sold are those from the first batch of 10. If we had considered a longer reporting period, thus including the initial purchase, the valuation of the sale would have been determined by the purchase price of the initial acquisition, not the second one.</p> </li> <li> <p>Earnings: Profit generated by the investment, consisting of dividends and interest. As can be seen in Figure 4, a dividend of 30 EUR (including fees and taxes) was paid for <code>share-1</code>. It was deposited in a cash account. That same cash account earns an interest, paid on July 1, 2023.</p> <p>Figure 4. Earnings panel. </p> <p>A summary per account with a breakdown of dividend, interest, total earnings, fees, and taxes is provided by the Earnings by Account panel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fees and taxes: Fees are charges imposed by banks, brokerage firms or investment platforms for their services. Taxes are levies imposed by the government on investment income. Fees and taxes are mostly recorded at the transaction itself (buy, sell, dividend, interest) but they can also be booked as a separate transaction.  For example, the one euro tax on the separate interest transaction is recorded as <code>Other</code> in Figure 1. The taxes on the purchase and dividend of share-1 are summed as 12 EUR.</p> <p>Figure 5. Taxes and Fees panel. </p> </li> <li> <p>Cash Currency Gains: read the following section about Performance neutral transfer first to better understand this topic. Since some deposits and investments are made in a foreign currency, e.g. AUD, cash currency gains or losses could occur. Some of losses are made at sale time. For example,  (see above capital gain). There is also a loss on the remaining deposit since Jan 1, 2023 on the AUD cash account. Since only 100 AUD was needed for the purchase, the remaining 400 AUD remains on the cash account. The loss on this deposit was 400 x (1/1.6263 - 1/1.5693) = -8.93 EUR</p> </li> <li> <p>Performance Neutral Transfers: A transfer refers to money that flows into or out of the portfolio; also named cash flow (CFin and CFout) in our performance equations.  This could be a deposit or removal (withdrawal) into or out of a deposit account. It could also be a delivery of securities into or out of a securities account. In the example of Figure 1, there is one deposit of 500 AUD at the beginning of 2023. Given an exchange rate of 0.6372 AUD/EUR, this constitutes a neutral transfer of 318.61 EUR.</p> <p>There was also a delivery of 5 x 20 USD shares on July 1. Given the exchange rate transfer of 0.9203 USD/EUR, this results in a neutral transfer of 92.03 EUR. Taken together, there was a performance neutral transfer of 410.64 EUR in 2023.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The term <code>Neutral transfer</code> stresses the fact that the transfer (of money or stock) on its own doesn't influence the performance. When an investor deposits money into their cash account, they are simply adding to the available cash balance. No profit has been made so far. The other categories (capital gains, earnings, fees &amp; taxes, cash currency gains) are transfers that do impact your profit or performance. They are not neutral to performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Final value: The final value represents the valuation of the chosen account or portfolio at the end date of the reporting period. Figure 6 provides a breakdown with the end value of each asset held within the portfolio or account. The final value corresponds with the MVE symbol (Market Value Begin) in our performance equations.</p> <p>Figure 6.

It indicates the total increase or decrease in asset value compared to the previous period, which can be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly. The performance over a longer period is calculated by compounding the daily returns.</p> <p>Figure 1. The daily performance chart of individual shares and the entire portfolio for a custom 2-year reporting period. </p> <p>For a detailed explanation of how cumulative performance is calculated, see the section on time-weighted performance. Since <code>share-2</code> was not purchased until September 30, 2022, its performance remains zero up to that date, implying that the performance of <code>share-1</code>and the portfolio are identical until then.</p> <p>The user interface of the Performance Chart is similar to the chart interface of View &gt; Reports &gt; Statement of Assets &gt; Chart. For example, the context menu is identical. We cover only the differences in this section; see link above for the common features.</p> <p>The <code>Configure chart</code> icon ( top right) provides an additional type of data series, called <code>Add benchmark ...</code> (see Figure 3). A benchmark is a security used solely for its historical prices to calculate daily and cumulative performance. Typically, a security with no purchase has a performance of zero. Therefore, a benchmark can be seen as a security with a single share, hypothetically purchased at the start of the reporting period. Naturally, this security does not affect overall portfolio performance.</p> <p>The graph in Figure 2 misleadingly suggests a gradual performance increase in the first and second quarters of 2022. Since a line graph connects consecutive (quarterly) data points, it visually implies a continuous change in performance, even though only two data points have been calculated. You can verify this by left-clicking on the chart canvas within a quarter and moving the cursor left or right to change dates. The performance remains unchanged within each quarter.</p> <p>Figure 2. Quarterly performance chart of share-1 and its benchmark. </p> <p>As can be seen in Figure 3, the increase in Q1 is not linear at all, but with ups and downs. Note that the performance starts at 0% because a new reporting period is selected (January 1 to March 31). </p> <p>Figure 3. Daily Performance chart of the first quarter of 2022. </p> <p>The graphs in Figure 2 &amp; 3 also shows that the performance starts to diverge between <code>share-1</code> and its benchmark from Quarter 1, 2022 on. This occurs due to the first purchase of <code>share-1</code> on 2022-01-14. Remember that Portfolio Performance always calculates daily performance: <code>1 + r = (MVE + CFOut)/(MVB + CFIn)</code> (Equation 1). The quarterly performance is just a compounding of daily performances.</p> <ul> <li>2022-01-13 (day before the purchase): historical price of <code>share-1</code> increased from 16.016 EUR/share to 16.026 EUR/share. The daily performance of <code>share-1 (benchmark)</code> is thus (16.026 / 16.016) -1 = 0.0624%. This is the same performance as for the existing investment of 10 shares of <code>share-1</code>: ((160.26 + 0) / (160.16 + 0)) - 1 = 0.0624%. For days without cash flows, <code>share-1</code> and its benchmark have the same daily performance.</li> <li>2022-01-14: the historical price drops from 16.026 to 15.962 EUR/share. The daily performance of <code>share-1 (benchmark)</code> decreases to (16.026 / 15.962) -1 = 0.040%. However, since an additional 5 shares are purchased on this day for 83 EUR (5 x 16 EUR/share + 3 EUR fees), the MVE of this security becomes 15 shares x 15.962 EUR/share = 239,43 EUR and the  daily performance = (( 239,43 + 0) / (160.26 + 83)) - 1 = -1.574%. Due to the fees, the benchmark has a better performance than the actual investment of 15 shares.</li> <li>Please note that the performance as can be read from Figure 3 is the cumulative performance, and as such different from the daily performance as calculated above. For the cumulative performance, you need to compound the daily performances. For the benchmark: r14 = (1+r1)x(1+r2)x ... (1+r12)x(1+0.0624%)x(1-1,574%) = -2.07%. </li> <li>The dividend payment on 2002-12-15 of 30 EUR (inclusive taxes) causes the second divergence.

The performance of <code>share-1</code> is ((15 * 18.898) + 30) / (15 * 19.166) = 9.04%.</li> <li>The sell transaction occurred on 2023-04-12: 5 shares at 22.4 EUR/share minus 5 EUR fees or 107 EUR.

Under this method, upon sale, the stock that was first purchased will also be the first sold, leaving the more recent purchases as the remaining stock. In a rising market, this means the most expensive shares remain and performance appears to be more favorable, especially when compared to the LIFO method.</p> <p>In the moving average method, no assumptions are made regarding which securities will be used upon a sale. It could be the first purchased, the last, or some randomly chosen shares. The weighted average price of the stock is calculated.

However, the difference becomes evident at the time of sales with a multiple purchase stock, such as <code>share-1</code>. The default FIFO method calculation amounts to 177.50 EUR (refer above for calculation details). The (simple) moving average methodis calculated as follows: initially 10 shares at 15.5 EUR/share (inclusive of fees and taxes) and later 5 shares at 20 EUR/share, resulting in [(10 x 15.5) + (5 x 20)] / (10 + 5) = 17 EUR/share.

All trades are listed in the <code>Reports &gt; Performance &gt; Trades</code> view. There are two kinds of trades:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Open Trade: An open trade is initiated with the first <code>Buy</code> or <code>Inbound Delivery</code> transaction for a security. The <code>Start Date</code> is set to the date of this initial transaction, while the <code>End Date</code> remains open as no <code>Sell</code> or <code>Outbound Delivery</code> has occurred yet. Subsequent purchases of the same security are added to this open trade, updating the number of shares and performance indicators such as Entry Value and Profit/Loss. Thus, an open trade can include multiple purchases.</p> </li> <li> <p>Closed Trade: A closed trade is generated with each <code>Sell</code> or <code>Outbound Delivery</code> transaction of a security. If you sell a specific security on three different dates, three separate closed trades will be created, each identified by their respective buy and sell dates. Selling a security can affect the <code>Start Date</code> of the associated open trade, as the system uses the FIFO (First In, First Out) methodology. If all shares from a specific purchase are sold, the <code>Start Date</code> of the open trade will shift to the date of the next purchase.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, in Figure 1, <code>share-1</code> has two associated trades, characterized by one sell transaction, depicted by the first closed trade (row 1), and two buy transactions, consolidated into the open trade (row 2).</p> <p>Figure 1.

If all shares from a particular purchase are sold (following the FIFO method), the start date will update to the date of the next purchase.</li> <li>End date: This is either the date when the security is sold or marked as (open) if the position is still active.

Hovering over the open trade (row 2) will reveal that 5 shares were purchased on January 15, 2021, and another 5 on January 14, 2022. Here, you can observe the FIFO principle in action.

You can find this value in Figure 1, in the top panel's last column. For an open trade with no sell transaction, this is the NTV of the purchase. For example, the purchase of <code>share-3</code> is accomplished by a single purchase with NTV of 1211.40 EUR; including (foreign) taxes and fees. For a buy + sell trade like <code>share-2</code>, the Net Transaction Value of the original purchase (67 EUR for 8 shares) is distributed over the open trade of the remaining 5 shares (41.88 EUR = 5/8 * 67 EUR) and the closed trade of 3 shares (25.13 EUR = 3/8 * 67 EUR).</p> <p>The situation is more complex with the 2 buy + 1 sell trade of <code>share-1</code>.  The original Net Transaction Value of the purchase of 10 shares on January 15, 2021, was 155 EUR. The second purchase of 5 shares had a net transaction value of 84 EUR. The entry value of the remaining 5 shares in the open trade (161.50 EUR) is formed by 5 shares from the first purchase and 5 from the second, following the FIFO principle in the sell transaction. The 5 shares that were sold came from the first purchase. The NTV of the open trade becomes then: (5/10 * 155 EUR) + (5/5 * 84 EUR) or 161.50 EUR.</p> </li> <li> <p>Entry value (per share): Enable this column by using the Settings  (gear) icon. The value can be easily calculated by dividing the Entry value by the number of shares.</p> </li> <li>Exit value: For open trades, this is the market value, which equals the number of shares multiplied by the current quote price. For example, the current quote price (Oct 11, 2024) of <code>share-2</code> is 11.645 EUR/share. The exit value is 5 x 11.645 = 58.23 EUR. For a closed trade, the exit value is the Net Transaction Value of the sale. For instance, <code>share-2</code> was sold on April 15, 2024: 3 shares x 12.48 EUR/share minus fees &amp; taxes (4 EUR). The exit value is thus 34.46 EUR.</li> <li>Exit value (per share): Similar to Entry value (per share); as described above.</li> <li>Profit/Loss: The profit/loss is the difference between the Exit value and the Entry value. Green numbers indicate a profit, while red numbers indicate a loss.</li> <li>Gross Profit/Loss: This equals the value of the previous column plus taxes and fees. </li> <li> <p>Holding period (days): For a single purchase closed trade, it equals the number of days between the End and the start date. For open trades, it is the difference between today and the Start date. This calculation does not consider weekends, holidays or any other calendar.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>For multiple purchase trades, the holding period is an average, weighted by the number of shares. For example, assuming today is 2024-10-13, then the holding period of <code>share-1</code> for the first purchase in Figure 2 is: (2024-10-13 - 2021-01-15) = 1367 days and for the second purchase (2024-10-13 - 2022-01-14) = 1003 days.

For example, in Figure 1, the Purchase Price differs slightly between the two methods (taxes and fees included): 16.15 EUR (MA) versus 15.93 EUR (FIFO) on 2023-09-12, but not on 2022-09-01 (15.93 EUR). Why? Let's take a look at the transactions:</p> <ul> <li>Purchase of 10 shares at 15.00 EUR on January 15, 2021, for a total amount of 155 EUR (including fees and taxes).</li> <li>Purchase of 5 shares at 16.00 EUR on January 14, 2022, for a total of 84 EUR.</li> <li>Sale of 5 shares at 22.40 EUR on April 12, 2023, for a total of 105 EUR.</li> </ul> <p>What is the Purchase Price of the remaining 10 shares in the portfolio?</p> <ul> <li>Moving Average Method: The average price of the original 15 shares is calculated as (155 + 84) / 15 = 15.93 EUR. The remaining 10 shares are valued at this price.</li> <li>FIFO Method: The remaining 10 shares consist of 5 shares from the first purchase and 5 shares from the second purchase. Their total value is calculated as (155 / 2) + 84 = 161.5 EUR. The FIFO average price is therefore 161.5 / 10 = 16.15 EUR.</li> </ul> <p>Profit/loss</p> <p>The <code>Profit/Loss</code> field represents the difference between the (current) <code>Market Value</code> and the <code>Purchase Value</code> (FIFO). For example, in Figure 1, the <code>Market Value</code> of <code>share-1</code> is 205.40 EUR. The calculated <code>Purchase Value</code> (FIFO) of the remaining 10 shares is 10 \u00d7 16.15 EUR/share, or 161.50 EUR. Therefore, the profit is 43.90 EUR.</p> <p>Performance &amp; Dividends</p> <p>The available fields under <code>Performance</code> and <code>Dividends</code> are discussed in a separate chapter.</p> <p>Attributes</p> <p>With the <code>Attributes</code> option, you can add custom fields to the table. These fields are defined in <code>left sidebar &gt; settings &gt; Attributes: Securities</code> or the menu <code>View &gt; Settings</code>and following panels. You can enter a specific attribute value for a security in the <code>Additional attributes</code> panel of the security (see for example, Figure 3 in Getting started &gt; Adding securities)</p> <p>Forex</p> <p>The <code>Forex</code> (Foreign Exchange) option allows you to view the currency of the quote for each asset and its exchange rate relative to the base currency of the portfolio. The fields labeled as <code>Market Value**</code>, <code>Purchase Price**</code>, and <code>Profit/Loss**</code> (with a double asterisk) retain the same meaning as their counterparts in the base currency (see above), but they are presented in the foreign currency. </p> <p>For instance, let's consider <code>share-3</code>, which is traded in USD. In the default view, the <code>Market Value</code> is expressed in EUR (127.96 in Figure 1, bottom half). If you wish to view that value in USD instead, you can achieve this by choosing the <code>Market Value**</code> field (see Figure 3).</p> <p>Distance to SMA</p> <p>Figure 3. Statement of Assets report of demo-portfolio-04.xml (Market Value **, SMA and ATH)</p> <p>The <code>Distance to SMA</code> is a metric that measures the difference between the current price of a share and the average price of that share over a specified number of past days. The acronym \"SMA\" presumably represents \"Simple Moving Average.\"</p> <p>When you choose to include this column, you'll also need to specify a period, such as 5 days, 20 days, 50 days, or 200 days. Suppose that you want to know the \u0394 to SMA5 (Distance to SMA for a 5 days period) of <code>share-1</code>. The last 5 available prices (before 2023-09-12) are: 20.43, 20.14, 20.015, 19.942, and 19.868 EUR/share. The calculation is carried out as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Calculate the average price of the last 5 days = (20.43 + ... + 19.868)/5 = 20.10 EUR.</li> <li>Calculate the difference of today's price with the average price = 20.43 - 20.08 = 0.33 EUR.</li> <li>Divide this difference by the average price and convert to a percentage = -0.33/20,43 = 1.62%. The last price is 1.62% higher than the average price of the last 5 days.</li> </ol> <p>Distance from ATH</p> <p><code>Distance from ATH</code> (All Time High) is a likewise metric that shows how far the last price in a reporting period is from the highest price in that period. You must select this period in a submenu. For example, the highest price of <code>share-1</code> in the year 2022 was 19,766 EUR on November 25, 2022. You can view the exact price and date of the all-time high (ATH) by hovering over the field. The last price in that period was 18.638 EUR/share on december 30, 2022. So the \u0394 ATH for 2022 (Distance to ATH for year 2022) is equal to (18.638 - 19.766)/19.766 or -5,71%.</p> <p>Price Range</p> <p>Figure 4.

However, the current price depends on the chosen time period.</p> <p>Figure 4 illustrates the price range for the year 2022, with the evaluation date set to September 12, 2023 (see also Figure 1). In this case, the current price is equal to the last available price/quote from the year 2022, e.g., December 30, 2022. This is NOT the quote price shown in the third column, which is the price at the evaluation date set by the Time Machine, e.g., 2023-09-12. If a more natural period, such as 1 year, is selected, the current price would indeed reflect the latest available quote.</p> <p>Hovering over the first (little black) bar of <code>share-1</code> displays a tooltip explaining the calculation of the price range: - The highest price in the period (All-Time High) is 19.766 EUR on November 25, 2022. - The lowest price in the period is 15.10 EUR on March 8, 2022. - The 'current price' is 18.638 EUR, which is the quote price on December 30, 2022.</p> <p>Assuming the difference between the highest and lowest prices represents 100%, the relative position of the current price against the lowest price is calculated as follows:</p> <p><code>(current price - lowest price) / (highest price - lowest price)</code></p> <p>For this example: <code>(18.638 - 15.10) / (19.766 - 15.10) = 75.83%</code></p> <p>The current price is positioned at 75.83% of the interval between the highest and lowest prices. The little black bar in the column is indeed located at approximately 3/4 of the column width. Alternatively, you can calculate how far the current price is from the highest price:</p> <p><code>(current price - highest price) / (highest price - lowest price)</code></p> <p>For this example: <code>(18.638 - 19.766) / (19.766 - 15.10) = -24.17%</code></p> <p>The sum of the absolute values of both indices equals 100%.</p>"},{"location":"reference/view/reports/statement/#multiple-charts","title":"Multiple charts","text":"<p>The information pane normally displays a chart of the security selected in the top pane.

In a forward stock split, e.g. 5-for-1, the number of shares increases and the price per share decreases proportionally. In a reverse stock split, e.g. 1-for-5, the number of shares decreases and the price per share increases proportionally. Regardless of the type, the total value of an investor\u2019s holdings remains the same.</p> <p>For example, by early 2022, Amazon's stock had risen to approximately 3,000 USD per share, a price too high for most investors (see Figure 2). To address this, Amazon approved a 20-for-1 stock split, which took effect on June 6, 2022. In this split, each existing share of the company's stock was divided into 20 new shares, with each new share worth one-twentieth of the original share price.</p> <p>Figure 2. Historical prices of Amazon.</p> <p>The resulting graph of the historical prices (see Figure 2) is unattractive and difficult to interpret; for instance, it\u2019s unclear by how much the stock rises in 2023-2024. Portfolio Performance currently handles stock splits in the same manner as most financial services, but this approach has some disadvantages (see the forum discussion). Essentially, it retroactively assumes that the shares have always been split. In the case of the 20-for-1 stock split mentioned earlier, the historical share prices before June 6, 2022, are adjusted to one-twentieth of their original value, while the quantity of shares in transactions is multiplied by 20; hereby breaking the link with the real figures on paper notes. For more detailed information and background, please refer to How-to &gt; Recording Stock Split.</p> <p>Selecting the Stock Split option will initiate a wizard that will guide you through three steps to execute the split. In Step 1 you select the security, and define the split date and the split ratio.</p> <p>You can use the drop-down menu to select the security if it's not already filled in. The Ex-date (execution date) is the date when the stock exchange first trades the split shares at the adjusted price. For instance, in case of the Amazon split, the Ex-date would be June 6, 2022. Additionally, you'll need to specify the split ratio, such as 20-for-1. A reverse split would be 1-for-20. It's worth noting that these ratios can also be decimal numbers.</p> <p>Figure 3. Split stock wizard - step 1. </p> <p>Step 2 will show you the impact of this stock split on each transaction (buy, sell, delivery). The result is that the number of shares in your possesion will be changed, according to the split ratio. You can skip this step and maintain the transactions unchanged by unchecking the <code>Convert transactions</code> option. If there aren't any transactions, this step has no effect.</p> <p>As can be seen in Figure 2 and 4, there was only one buy transaction on January 3, 2022 (before the split date) of one share. Thus, from Janary 3, 2022 on, you will have 20 shares in your account, given that the default <code>Convert transactions</code> is checked.</p> <p>The historical prices can be adjusted in the the following step.</p> <p>Figure 4. Split stock wizard - step 2. </p> <p>Step 3 will show you the converted historical prices. If you don't want to change the historical prices, uncheck <code>Convert historical quotes</code>. It's important to note that only prices before the split date will be changed; e.g. Quote (new). Prices after the split will naturally be automatically adjusted correctly by the exchange market.</p> <p>The conversion is simple math. For example, on June 3 the old price was 2443 USD. The new price will be 1/20 or 122 USD.</p> <p>Figure 5. Split stock wizard - step 3. </p> <p>In the chart view of the historical prices, a small vertical line with the split ratio at the bottom will indicate the Stock split. With the  menu <code>Configure Chart &gt; Marking &gt; Events</code> you can toggle this line. You can also delete the event in the Events tab in the bottom panel; see Events. This will remove the marker in the chart but will NOT remove the split from the transactions and historical prices.</p> <p>Figure 6. Result of Split stock wizard (Amazon). </p> <p>Please note the difference between this chart and Figure 2. The rise in 2023 and 2024 is clearly visible, with prices before June 6, 2022 aligning with the adjusted prices. For example, the Buy transaction on January 3, 2022, of one share at approximately 3,400 USD is now shown as a Buy transaction of 20 shares at around 170 USD each.</p>"},{"location":"reference/view/securities/context-menu/#event","title":"Event","text":"<p>An event is a kind of note that could be attached to a specific security on a particular date.

The sum of allocations within a category must always add up to 100%.</li> <li>Weight: The proportion or percentage that a security can contribute to its total value.

Setting the weight to 0% removes the security from the category, placing it in the <code>Without Classification</code> list.</li> </ul> <p>The rebalancing process will calculate the target value for each category based on its allocation and the total portfolio value. If the actual value deviates from the target value, the system computes the difference (delta).
